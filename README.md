Stereotactic model of the electrical distribution within the internal globus pallidus during deep brain stimulation.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) is an established surgical technique for the treatment of movement disorders. The objective of this study was to propose a computational stereotactic model of the electrical distribution around the electrode within the targeted GPi in order to optimize parameter adjustment in clinical practice. The outline of the GPi can be defined precisely by using stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and from this it is possible to model its three-dimensional structure. The electrode and the distribution of the patient-specific parameters can then be co-registered with the GPi volume. By using this methodology, it is possible to visualize and measure the relationship between the electrical distribution of patient-specific parameters and the morphology of the GPi. The model could be applied in clinical practice to help determine the threshold for achieving a therapeutic effect and consequently may aid in optimizing parameter settings for individual patients.
